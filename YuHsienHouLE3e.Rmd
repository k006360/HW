The USArrests dataset is in ISLR package, and is used in the Chapter 10 R lab examples.

# ISLR 10 Exercise 10.8 

Principal Components Analysis

In Section 10.2.3, a formula for calculating proportion of variance explained 
(PVE) was given in Equation 10.8.

![alt text](figs/ISLR-eq10p8.png)

We also saw that the PVE can be obtained using the sdev output of the prcomp() function.

On the USArrests data (in the ISLR package), calculate PVE in two ways:

## (a) 
Using the sdev output of the prcomp() function, as was done in Section 10.2.3.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

data(USArrests)
Scaled <- scale(USArrests)
compar <- prcomp(Scaled)
compv <- compar$sdev^2
compv
compv/sum(compv)
```

## (b) 
By applying Equation 10.8 directly. 
That is, use the prcomp() function to  compute the principal component loadings. 
Then, use those loadings in Equation 10.8 to obtain the PVE.

```{r}
# Put your code here, with comments and good style and syntax
head(Scaled) %>% kable
compar$rotation %>% kable
dim(Scaled)
dim(compar$rotation)

Scaled %*% compar$rotation %>% (function(x) x^2) %>% as.tibble %>% rowwise() %>% map_df(sum) %>% ungroup() %>% (function(x) x/sum(Scaled^2))
```

These two approaches should give the same results.

Hint: You will only obtain the same results in (a) and (b) if the same data is used in both cases. 

For instance, if in (a) you performed prcomp() using centered and scaled variables, then you must center
and scale the variables before applying Equation 10.3 in (b).

# ISLR 10 Exercise 9 

Heirarchical Clustering

Consider the USArrests data. We will now perform hierarchical clustering on the states.

## (a) 
Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.

```{r}
set.seed(2)
hc<- hclust(dist(Scaled), method = "complete")

plot(hc)




```

## (b) 
Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters. 

Which states belong to which clusters?

```{r}
cutree(hc, 3)



```

## (c) 
Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation one.

```{r}
s <- scale(Scaled)
shc <- hclust(dist(s), method = "complete")

plot(shc)
```

## (d) 
What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained? 

In your opinion, should the variables be scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed?

Provide a justification for your answer.

```{r}
cutree(shc, 3)
table(cutree(hc, 3), cutree(shc, 3))



```


# ISLR 10 Exercise 11

There is a gene expression data set in your repo in 1-assignments/LabExcercise/data/Ch10Ex11.csv.

This consists of 40 tissue samples with measurements on 1,000 genes. 

The first 20 samples are from healthy patients, while the second 20 are from a diseased group.

## (a) 
Load in the data using read.csv(). You will need to select header=F.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("/Users/k0063/cwrudsci-20s-dsci353-353m-453-prof-f678d9ea895a/1-assignments/lab-exercise/LE3/data/Ch10Ex11.csv", header=F)
dim(data)
```

## (b) 
Apply hierarchical clustering to the samples using correlationbased distance, and plot the dendrogram. 

Do the genes separate the samples into the two groups? 

Do your results depend on the type of linkage used?

```{r}
sing <- hclust(as.dist(1-cor(data)),method='single')
comp <- hclust(as.dist(1-cor(data)),method = 'complete')

plot(sing)
plot(comp)



```

## (c) 
Your collaborator wants to know which genes differ the most across the two groups. 

Suggest a way to answer this question, and apply it here.

```{r}
pr=prcomp(t(data))
head(order(abs(rowSums(pr$rotation)),decreasing = T))




```

#### LE1a, 3 points.

  -  Question 1 = 1 points
  -  Question 2 = 2 points

Details

  - Due Wednesday June 12th
    - Before Class
  - The grading is done on how you show your thinking, 
    - explain yourself and 
    - show your Rcode and 
    - the output you got from your code.
  - Code style is important
    - Follow Rstudio code diagnostics notices
    - And the [Google R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)

To be done as an Rmd file, 

  - where you turn in 
    - the Rmd file and 
    - the compiled pdf showing your work. 
    - and the R script of IntroR.R
    
You will want to produce a report type format 

  - (html and pdf type document) to turn in. 
  - And not an ioslides or beamer (slide type) compiled output. 
    - These are presentation formats, and can be fussy

Also are you backing up your git repo 

  - in a second and third location, 
  - to avoid corruption problems?



#### 1. Pipes and Pipelines for Literate Code

We have seen pipe %>% notation, 

  - You can read about them in
    - In dplyr package help
    - In Hadley Wickham's "R 4 Data Science" book
  - This is a practice for you to begin using pipelines
  - All work must be done using only one dplyr pipeline per question 
    - with no intermediate variables, 
    - including using summarise() to get results
  - For reference, here are examples of 
    - correct and incorrect answers for a problem

Example: What is the average petal length of setosa irises?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# incorrect
data("iris")
df <- iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa") 

mean(df$Petal.Length)

# correct
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  summarise(mean(Petal.Length))

```

1a: What is the max, min, and average price of diamonds with a "Very Good" cut?
 
```{r}

data("diamonds")
head(diamonds)
str(diamonds)
?diamonds
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Very Good') %>% summarise(max(price))
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Very Good') %>% summarise(min(price))
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Very Good') %>% summarise(mean(price))

```

1b: What is the average carat weight for each cut of diamond? 
 
```{r}
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Fair') %>% summarise(mean(carat))
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Good') %>% summarise(mean(carat))
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Very Good') %>% summarise(mean(carat))
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Premium') %>% summarise(mean(carat))
diamonds %>% filter(cut=='Ideal') %>% summarise(mean(carat))


```

1c: Add a variable that is a ratio of the price per weight for each diamond. 

  - Which cut of diamond has the highest average price to weight ratio and what is it?

```{r}
pc <- diamonds %>% mutate(pc=price/carat)
pc %>% filter(cut=='Fair') %>% summarise(mean(pc))
pc %>% filter(cut=='Good') %>% summarise(mean(pc))
pc %>% filter(cut=='Very Good') %>% summarise(mean(pc))
pc %>% filter(cut=='Premium') %>% summarise(mean(pc))
pc %>% filter(cut=='Ideal') %>% summarise(mean(pc))

#Premium has the highest avg. 
achiavgprice <- pc %>% filter(cut=='Premium') %>% summarise(mean(pc))
```

1d: What is the 100th most expensive diamond in each color group of at least 0.30 carets? 

  - (show only price and color variables) 
 
```{r}
adset <- pc %>% filter(carat>=0.3) %>% arrange(color) %>% arrange(price)
  ad_D <- adset %>% filter(color=='D') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='D')
  ad_D <- ad_D %>% nth(7)
  ad_D <- ad_D %>% nth(6593-99)

  ad_E <- adset %>% filter(color=='E') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='E')
  ad_E <- ad_E %>% nth(7)
  ad_E <- ad_E %>% nth(9232-99)
  
  ad_F <- adset %>% filter(color=='F') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='F')
  ad_F <- ad_F %>% nth(7)
  ad_F <- ad_F %>% nth(9130-99)
  
  ad_G <- adset %>% filter(color=='G') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='G')
  ad_G <- ad_G %>% nth(7)
  ad_G <- ad_G %>% nth(11075-99)
  
  ad_H <- adset %>% filter(color=='H') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='H')
  ad_H <- ad_H %>% nth(7)
  ad_H <- ad_H %>% nth(8136-99)
  
  ad_I <- adset %>% filter(color=='I') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='I')
  ad_I <- ad_I %>% nth(7)
  ad_I <- ad_I %>% nth(5373-99)

  ad_J <- adset %>% filter(color=='J') %>% arrange(price)
  adset %>% count(color=='J')
  ad_J <- ad_J %>% nth(7)
  ad_J <- ad_J %>% nth(2802-99)


```

#### 2. ggplot2

ggplot2 is a package for making plots from data. 

It provides tools for making complex and detailed graphs. 

ggplot2 builds graphs in layers, 

  - where first the graph must be specified, 
  - then layers are added to the plot using the '+' operator.

In this example nothing appears in the plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("mpg")

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))

```

This is because I did not define the next layer, 

  - all I did was define some kind of graph between cylinders and highway mpg

Since we have already defined the data at the beginning, 

  - we don't need to specify it in the layer

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

# or a different layer

# here we have to define cyl as the group for each box
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cyl))

```

We can add additional information about showing data in our plot 

  - by adding parameters into the aesthetics (aes()) function

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = displ))

```

We can also add on additional layers if we want to, 

  - keep in mind ordering is important. 
  
The data for each layer can be defined per layer 

  - this is important if you're trying to add multiple data sets to a plot

```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy), method = "lm")

```

Now it's your turn to make some plots

  - All plotting must be done using ggplot2, 
  - Any data manipulation must be done with dplyr pipelines 
    - running into the ggplot funciton

2a: Use the mtcars data set, 
  
  - plot mpg vs displacement and color by cylinders
 
```{r}

data("mtcars")
?mtcars
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg,y=disp,color=factor(cyl)))+geom_point()


```

2b: Create a boxplot of the horsepower readings for each cylinder count, 

  - show the data points on top of the plot
 
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=cyl,y=hp,color=factor(cyl)))+geom_boxplot()+geom_point()
```

2c: Plot a histogram of the number cars in each carburetor count group

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=carb,fill=factor(cyl)))+geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5)
```

2d: Explain why these two plots look different, 

  - why does the color and key change between them?
 
```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl, size = displ))

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl), size = displ))

```
#ANS:
  Using factor function (factor()) is commanding it to choose the number of colors vary with the number of the given variables, However, without using the factor function, it will automatically using a smoothly continuous change of spectrum to represent the variable difference.
